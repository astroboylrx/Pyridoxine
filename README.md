# Pyridoxine: Handy Python Snippets for Athena Data

This branch contains useful Python snippets for analyzing simulation data produced by code [Athena](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/Athena-Cversion).

`Pyridoxine` is able to read `vtk` and `lis` files efficiently and the users can then post-process these data.  [This Jupyter Notebook](https://gist.github.com/astroboylrx/332611f562e4817c011800353ddb5a21) gives a simple demo.
